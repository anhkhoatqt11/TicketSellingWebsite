## üïµÔ∏è Admin
The website will be administered by an administrator equipped with various functions to ensure effective management.

User management capabilities include the ability to edit user information and control user accounts by unlocking or locking them as needed. Additionally, the administrator can manage events by editing their status, ensuring oversight and control over the event-related activities. The banner management feature allows the administrator to dynamically showcase events on the website by adding, modifying positions, or removing events from the banner display. These functions collectively empower the administrator to maintain the platform's integrity, facilitate user interactions, and strategically highlight events through effective banner management.
